Dear osemosys modelling community,

I'm currently working on a project using osemosys and otoole to model the APEC region, and I'm trying to speed up the solve time by using the CBC solver instead of the default GLPK solver. However, I've run into an issue and I'm hoping someone can help me resolve it. I believe it is to do with our Windows setup at the office. 

I've attached the instructions i made for the installation and the input file used when running the command. And then below I've posted the error message i get when i try to run the model.

The error message is:

command:
cbc ./tmp/19_THA/cbc_test/cbc_input_19_THA_Reference.lp solve solu ./tmp/19_THA/cbc_test/cbc_results_19_THA_Reference.sol

output:
C:/folder/power-model/env/Library/bin/cbc.exe: error while loading shared libraries: ucrtbased.dll: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Iâ€™ve tried a few things but nothing on the internet gives me any certainty about what I should do. 

Note, I've also tried to use the osemosys-cloud.com website as an alternative but I'm having different issues with that, which i've posted on their github.
